<h3>The story</h3>

You are in Vegas with your wife and her family.  On morning number 1, they all
want to go to the "Venetian" hotel and casino to ride the Gondolas.  You have
the choice of going or staying.  Hmmm, let's see.  You've already overpaid once
in your life to ride a real gondola in Venice.  It's something like 500 bazillion
degrees in Vegas, and the gondola rides are in a big concrete 
swimming pool.  You thank the family, but send them on their merry way.
<p>
You wander around the casino, and see this game called <i>Keno</i>.  It's a
bit like a lottery.  There are 80 balls numbered 1 through 80, and they will
pick 20 of them randomly.  They have a catchy little flier about all the 
Keno bets you can make:
<p>
<table border=3>
<td valign=top> <IMG src=jpg/K1.jpg width=350></td>
<td valign=top> <IMG src=jpg/K2.jpg width=200><br>
                <IMG src=jpg/K3.jpg width=200></td>
<td valign=top> <IMG src=jpg/K4.jpg width=200></td>
</table>
<p>
The whole flier is <a href=jpg/Keno.jpg>here</a>.
<p>
Now, we're talking entertainment!  You know there's no way that these
tempting little bets are going to make you money in the long run, but
have a little mathematical problem to solve, and that's better
than gambling!
Your job is to figure out which of these bets is the best -- in other words,
which one will lose you the least amount of money in the long run.
<p>
Let's analyze the bet sheet.  On the "2-Bit Menu" you will pay a quarter per
game, which you will not get back.  Let's say you choose the "5 catch win."  This
means that you will pick five numbers.  They will pick 20.  If exactly three
of your five numbers are in their twenty, they pay you a quarter (i.e. you
get your money back).  If exactly four of your five are in their twenty, 
then they pay you a dollar.  And if all five are your numbers are in their
twenty, you win $200!!!!!  Whoo-hoo!!!
<p>
So, suppose you want to calculate what the average return on your investment 
will be.  The probability of matching exactly three balls is 0.0839351.  
The probability of matching exactly four balls is 0.0120923.
And the probability of matching exactly five is 0.000644925.
I'll show you how to calculate those later.  So, to calculate your return:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> You always lose your initial 0.25
<LI> 8.39351 percent of the time, you win back 0.25.  
<LI> 1.20923 percent of the time, you win back a dollar
<LI> 0.0644925 percent of the time, you win $200.
<LI> Therefore, your return is -0.25 + 0.0839351 * (0.25) + 0.0120923 * (1) 
+ 0.000644925 * (200).  That is -0.087939, so you lose roughly nine cents 
on every 25 cent bet.
<LI> If you care to normalize that to the dollar, you normalized return is 
-0.087939/.25 = -0.35 per bet.  That's one lousy bet.  At least it only 
costs a quarter (although the fine print says you have to play 21 times....)
</UL>

<hr>
Onto the lab.  In mathematics, a binomial coefficient <i>binom(n,k)</i> is
defined to equal (n!)/((k!)(n-k)!).  It represents the number of ways to choose
<i>k</i> distinct items from a collection of <i>n</i>.  Therefore, the total
number of ways that you can choose 20 balls from 80 is  <i>binom(80,20) = (80!)/(20!60!)</i>.
<p>
In Keno, suppose you pick <i>p</i> balls.  Then the number of ways to match
exactly <i>c</i> of those <i>p</i> in the twenty randomly chosen balls is:
<p>
<center>
<i>binom(80-p,20-c) * binom(p,c)</i>
</center>
<p>
So, the probability of you matching exactly exactly <i>c</i> of <i>p</i> is:
<p>
<center>
<i>binom(80-p,20-c) * binom(p,c) / binom(80,20)</i>
</center>
<p>

Let's take a concrete example.  If we choose five balls and want to match exactly
three, that's: <i>binom(75,17) * binom(5,3) / binom(80,20)</i>.  Which equals:
<p>
<center><img src=jpg/binom1.jpg height=50></center><p>
Fortunately, we can cancel quite a few of these terms.  For example, 
(75!)/(80!) = 1/(80*79*78*77*76).  And 
(5!)/(3!) = 5*4.  
We can keep cancelling until we get:
<p><center><img src=jpg/binom2.jpg height=50></center><p>
This equals 0.0839351. 
<p>
(For the true nerds, yes, we can do a prime factorization and cancel many more terms,
but for the purposes of this lab, we'll just do simple cancellations).

<h3>Your Job: #1: fraction.cpp</h3>

You are to write two programs: <b>src/fraction.cpp</b> and <b>src/keno.cpp</b>.
<p>
The first implements a class called a "fraction", defined
in
<b><a href=include/fraction.hpp>include/fraction.hpp</a></b>.
Please read the comments in the header
file for description:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>

#include &lt;set&gt;

<font color=blue>/* The Fraction class manages a fraction, where the numerator and the denominator
   are both products of positive integers.  Internally, you will represent the fraction
   as two multisets -- one for the numerator and one for the denominator.  You want to
   make sure that the same number does not appear in both the numerator and denominator.
   When that happens, you should delete the number from both the numerator and the
   denominator.

   You manipulate the product with the first eight methods.  Print() prints the
   fraction and Calculate() calculates the fraction as a double. See the method
   descriptions for more information. 

   For the methods that return a bool, return true when the operation is successful,
   and false if the parameters are bad. */</font>

class Fraction {
  public:
    void Clear();                       <font color=blue>// Clear both the numerator and denominator</font>

    bool Multiply_Number(int n);        <font color=blue>// Add a number to the numerator</font>
    bool Divide_Number(int n);          <font color=blue>// Add a number to the denominator</font>

    bool Multiply_Factorial(int n);     <font color=blue>// Add the numbers 2 through n to the numerator</font>
    bool Divide_Factorial(int n);       <font color=blue>// Add the numbers 2 through n to the denominator</font>

</pre></td></table></center><p>

In the various calls, <b>n</b> must be a positive integer, and <b>k</b> must be
greater than or equal to zero (anything choose 0 is equal to one).  If any of these
are bad, the various calls should return <b>false</b>.
<p>
The only subtle method is <b>Print()</b>.  The way this works is to
print the numerator as a bunch of products, and then the denominator 
as a bunch of quotients.  See below for examples.
<p>

To help you test, I have a program called
<b><a href=fraction_tester.cpp>fraction_tester.cpp</a></b>, where you can 
enter commands on standard input to manipulate a fraction and test these methods.
You call it with an optional prompt:

CLEAR          -- Clear the fraction back to one.
CALCULATE      -- Calculate the fraction.
INVERT         -- Swap the numerator and denominator.
PRINT          -- Print the fraction as an equation.
MULTIPLY n     -- Multiply the fraction by n.
DIVIDE n       -- Divide the fraction by n.

When you compile your <b>src/fraction.cpp</b> with 
<b><a href=src/fraction_tester.cpp>src/fraction_tester.cpp</a></b> (which is done
in the <b>makefile</b>), your output should match mine
<i>exactly</i>.  Many of the grading script's tests will use <b>fraction_tester</b> 
to test your program.  

<hr>
<h3>Your Job: #2: keno.cpp</h3>

Now that you've written <b>src/fraction.cpp</b>, use it to write <b>src/keno.cpp</b>,
which calculates Keno odds using the formula above.  <b>Keno.cpp</b> should
read numbers on standard input using <b>cin</b>.  The first number will be the amount to bet, 
and the second should be the number of balls that you are going to pick.
After that, there will be pairs of numbers that compose the winning table.
These will be in the order <i>catch, payout</i>, where <b>catch</b> is the
exact number of balls to match, and <b>payout</b> is the payout of that 
number of balls.  You do not need to error check.
<p>
So, for example, the "5 catch win" above would be represented with:
<pre>
0.25 5    3 0.25   4 1   5 200
</pre>

Now the first line of your program should print out the bet, and the second
line should print the balls picked.  The bet should be padded to two
decimal places (use <b>printf</b> instead of <b>cout</b>).  Then for each 
payout, you should print the probability of winning and the expected 
return (probability times payout).  Use <b>cout</b> for these lines
and have them match mine exactly.  Finally, you should print the 
expected return per bet, which is the sum of all expected returns minus
the bet.  Have this padded to two decimal places (use <b>printf</b> instead of <b>cout</b>).  
Finally, print the normalized return, which is the expected return divided by the
bet.  Again, pad that to two decimal places.  
<p>
This lets us evaluate all the Keno options in the flier.  First, the "2-bit menu":

<h3>This is no longer required -- I just include it for amusement</h3>

You are visiting your aunt and uncle, and as you walk by their 
computer room, you hear your eight-year-old neice Pippy swearing
up a storm in front of her computer.  As you probe, you realize
that she's blowing a simulated wad of money on
<a href=http://onlinekeno.net/play-free-keno/online-keno>Free Online Keno</a>!!!
<p>
Using your newfound understanding of Keno and your ability to 
program, write up a paragraph that shows Pippy how much she is losing
on each of her fifteen potential Keno bets.  

<p>

<h3>Doing Keno in Stages</h3>

<b>Keno.cpp</b> is a very small program (mine is 56 lines), but you can still
do it in stages.  For example, I did it in three stages.  Stage 1 just prints
out the input:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo "0.25 5    3 0.25   4 1   5 200" | bin/keno1</b></font>
Bet: 0.25
Balls Picked: 5
  Catch 3/5 - 0.25
  Catch 4/5 - 1.00
  Catch 5/5 - 200.00
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

Stage 2 calculates the probabilities.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo "0.25 5    3 0.25   4 1   5 200" | bin/keno2</b></font>
Bet: 0.25
Balls Picked: 5
  Probability of catching 3 of 5: 0.0839351
  Probability of catching 4 of 5: 0.0120923
  Probability of catching 5 of 5: 0.000644925
UNIX>
</pre>

And then stage three finishes everything up.
